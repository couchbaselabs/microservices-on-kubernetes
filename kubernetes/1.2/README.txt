ABOUT COUCHBASE SERVER

Couchbase Server is an open source, distributed NoSQL document database.
Couchbase Server enables developers to build applications with agility by
combining the flexibility of JSON data with the power of SQL-like queries, using
N1QL, or through built-in full-text search capabilities.

The platform gives you the flexibility to constantly reinvent the customer
experience, from any cloud to every edge device. Using in-memory dataset
capabilities, the platform can be scaled to match needs for volume, volatility,
and speed of data.

By providing a flexible data model, consistent high performance, elastic
scalability, and always-on availability, Couchbase Server enables enterprises to
operate at any scale with enterprise-level security.

Its memory-centric architecture is designed to provide low-latency data
management for large-scale interactive web, mobile, and IoT applications.
